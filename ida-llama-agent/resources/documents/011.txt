Product details
The self-storing leaf is easy to insert to extend the table from 4 to 6 and just as easy to remove and tuck away under the table top when your guests have gone home.

The table top has a hardwood veneer top layer that is both stained and lacquered for durability and to allow the natural wooden texture to shine through.

The smart design means that the table top has no seams when you use the table without extending it.

Designed for a perfect match with EKEDALEN chairs. ÄLVSTA, LIDÅS, KRYLBO and KARLPETTER chairs are also good matches with different style expressions.

Solid wood underframe makes the construction very sturdy.

This table has been tested against our strictest standards for stability, durability and safety to withstand everyday use in your home for years.
