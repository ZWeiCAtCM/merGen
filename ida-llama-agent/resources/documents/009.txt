Small dimensions make the table easy to furnish with, even when space is limited.

The sturdy solid wood frame is stained in a fresh white color to brighten up on any gloomy day.

The grains of the wood are visible and create a warm and natural expression.

Designed for a perfect match with PINNTORP chairs. STEFAN chairs are also good matches with different style expressions.

Wood is a natural material and variations in the top and the legs make every table unique.
