Product details
The table has a full plank design that gives it an authentic plank expression with a genuine wood feeling.

Oak is an exceedingly strong and durable hardwood with a prominent grain. It darkens beautifully with age acquiring a golden-brown undertone.

Every table is unique, with varying grain pattern and natural color shifts that are part of the charm of wood.

This table matches well with TOBIAS chair and GRÖNSTA, MÅRENÄS and TOSSBERG chairs with armrests for different style expressions.

Tested and approved for use in public areas, such as restaurants, which means it is extra durable and stands up to extensive, everyday use.
