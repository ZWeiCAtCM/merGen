Smart construction and a handcrafted look made our LISABO table series a winner of the Red Dot Design Award in 2016.

The table surface in ash veneer and legs in solid birch give a warm, natural feeling to your room.

Designed for a perfect match with LISABO chairs. ÄLVSTA, RÖNNINGE and KARLPETTER chairs are also good matches with different style expressions.

Ash is a strong hardwood material with a beautiful grain pattern. As it ages the color deepens moderately towards a deep straw color.

Easy to assemble as each leg has only one screw.

This table has been tested against our strictest standards for stability, durability and safety to withstand everyday use in your home for years.
