Product details
Easy to bring home since the whole dining set is packed in one box.

Solid pine is a natural material that ages beautifully and acquires its own unique character over time.

The untreated wood is beautiful as it is, but can also be personalized with a coat or two of paint in your favorite color.

If you oil, wax, lacquer or stain the untreated solid wood surface it will be more durable and easy to care for.

For a softer seat or to add a personal touch to the room, complete with a chair pad in the style and color of your choice.
