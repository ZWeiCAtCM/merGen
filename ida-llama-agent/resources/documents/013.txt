Product details
Small dimensions make the table easy to furnish with, even when space is limited.

The table is very sturdy thanks to the metal frame.

The melamine table top is moisture resistant, stain resistant and easy to keep clean.

You can create a bigger table by placing two or more MELLTORP tables next to each other. You can for instance place a small MELLTORP table next to a larger one.

You can stack the chairs, so they take less space when you're not using them.
